### Luigi Lorenzoni
This repository provides codes related to Bernanke and Blanchard (2023). Firstly, I provide a replication package in R for all the results of the paper. Secondly, I provide the code for a fiscal extension of their empirical model,which constitutes the core of my [undergraduate thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b37gdpdzzeugwhygr2tqg/tesi_lorenzoni_def.pdf?rlkey=h1hlmgj1177jjxcz2m4cpgpr6&st=rxwyc3uq&dl=0).
